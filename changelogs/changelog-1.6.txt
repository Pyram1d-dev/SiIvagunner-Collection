WHAT'S NEW:
- New rips n shit
- Whitty rips!
- Resuming a paused game will give you a countdown (so you aren't jumpscared by incoming notes)
- Modchart improvements!
- Filesystem changes
- Characters are now all loaded from JSON files
- Changed all moving elements (menu items, camera panning, etc.) to scale according to framerate (same speed no matter what framerate)
- Optimization
- Fixed bug that would misplace the progress bar if scroll direction is changed
- Set the progress bar to be ON by default (and now it just kinda looks like the psych engine one)
